    <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
            Automobiles Ettore Bugatti was a German then French manufacturer of high-performance automobiles. The
            company was founded in 1909 in the then-German city of Molsheim, Alsace, by the Italian-born industrial
            designer Ettore Bugatti. The cars were known for their design beauty and for their many race victories.
            Famous Bugatti automobiles include the Type 35 Grand Prix cars, the Type 41 "Royale", the Type 57 "Atlantic"
            and the Type 55 sports car.

            The death of Ettore Bugatti in 1947 proved to be a severe blow for the marque, and the death of his son Jean
            in 1939 meant that there was no successor to lead the factory. No more than about 8,000 cars were made. The
            company struggled financially, and it released one last model in the 1950s before eventually being purchased
            for its airplane parts business in 1963.

            In 1987, an Italian entrepreneur bought the brand name and revived it as Bugatti Automobili SpA.

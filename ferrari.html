    <h2>Overview</h2>
    
    <p>
        Ferrari S.p.A. is an Italian luxury sports car manufacturer based in
        Maranello, Italy. Founded in 1939 by Enzo Ferrari (1898-1988), the company adopted its current name in 1945 and
        began producing its line of cars in 1947. Ferrari became a public companyin 1960, and from 1963 to 2014 it was
        a subsidiary of Fiat S.p.A. It was spun off from Fiat's successor entity, Fiat Chrysler Automobiles, in 2016.
        The company currently offers a large model range which includes several supercars, grand tourers, and one SUV.
        Many early Ferraris, dating to the 1950s and 1960s, count among the most expensive cars ever sold at auction.
        Owing to a combination of its cars, enthusiast culture, and successful licensing deals, in 2019 Ferrari was
        labelled the world's strongest brand by the financial consultency Brand Finance.

        Throughout its history, the company has been noted for its continued participation in racing, especially in
        Formula One, where its team, Scuderia Ferrari, are the series' single oldest and most successful. Scuderia
        Ferrari have raced since 1929, first in Grand Prix events and later in Formula One, where since 1952 they have
        fielded fifteen champion drivers, won sixteen Constructors' Championships, and accumulated more race victories,
        1-2 finishes, podiums, pole positions, fastest laps and points than any other team in F1 history.
        Historically, Ferrari was also highly active in sports car racing, where its cars took many victories in races
        like the Mille Miglia, Targa Florio and 24 Hours of Le Mans. Scuderia Ferrari fans, commonly called tifosi, are

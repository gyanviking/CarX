    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>
        Mercedes, officially known as Mercedes-Benz, is a German automotive brand renowned for producing luxury
        vehicles, buses, coaches, and trucks. The brand is recognized for its high-quality engineering, innovative
        technologies, and a strong emphasis on luxury and performance.

        Mercedes-Benz traces its roots back to the late 19th century. The company's founders, Karl Benz and Gottlieb
        Daimler, played a significant role in the development of the automobile industry. Karl Benz is often credited
        with inventing the first true automobile in 1885, while Daimler and his engineer Wilhelm Maybach created one of
        the first internal combustion engines suitable for vehicles.

        The merger of Karl Benz's and Gottlieb Daimler's companies in 1926 led to the formation of the brand<em>
        "Mercedes-Benz,"</em> which brought together their expertise in automobile and engine manufacturing. The brand's name
        <em>"Mercedes"</em> comes from a car model created by Daimler in honor of Mercedes Jellinek, the daughter of an important
        Daimler dealer.

        Over the years, Mercedes-Benz has become synonymous with luxury, elegance, and cutting-edge technology. The
        brand offers a wide range of vehicles, including sedans, SUVs, coupes, convertibles, and sports cars. Some of
        their notable vehicle lines include the C-Class, E-Class, S-Class, GLE, GLC, and the high-performance AMG
        models.

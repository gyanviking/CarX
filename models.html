    <h1>TESLA MODEL-S</h1>
    <img src="models1.png" alt="car">
    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>
        Tesla was founded in 2003 by a group of engineers, including Martin Eberhard and Marc Tarpenning. Elon Musk, an
        entrepreneur and business magnate, joined the company shortly after its founding and became the primary driving
        force behind its success. Musk is currently the CEO of Tesla.

        Tesla is best known for its electric vehicles (EVs), which include the Model S, Model 3, Model X, Model Y, and
        upcoming vehicles like the Tesla Cybertruck and the Tesla Roadster (second generation). These vehicles are
        designed to be high-performance, environmentally friendly alternatives to traditional gasoline-powered cars.

        Tesla has been a pioneer in autonomous driving technology. The company's vehicles come equipped with Autopilot,
        an advanced driver-assistance system that can handle certain driving tasks on highways. Tesla is also working on
        Full Self-Driving (FSD) technology, which aims to enable vehicles to navigate without human intervention.
